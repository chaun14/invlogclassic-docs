# Alpha Bot

The `InviteManager Alpha` bot is the bot we use to test new features. The new features on the Alpha bot will not always be stable, but if you use this bot, you'll be the first to see them and you can give us feedback how we can make them better before they will be included in the main bot.

Invite the InviteManager Alpha here: [Invite](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=412380586737664020&permissions=268435616&scope=bot&redirect_uri=https://google.com)
